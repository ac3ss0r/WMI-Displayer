# WMI-Displayer
WMI Disaplayer is a small .NET program that I've made for getting Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes and values easily.

## Features
- Loading all of existing Windows Management Instrumentation classes and viewing their keys & values
## TODO
- [x] Making the program multi-theaded (async WMI calls)
- [ ] WMI spoofing via injection & hooks
- [ ] WMI method listing & calling
