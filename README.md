# WMI-Displayer
WMI Disaplayer is a small .NET program that I've made for getting Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes and values easily.

## Features
- Loading all of existing Windows Management Instrumentation classes and viewing their keys & values
## Left to add
- The program is currently single-threaded and WMI loading is sometimes slow, so the GUI can freeze for a while. Need to add multi-threading.
